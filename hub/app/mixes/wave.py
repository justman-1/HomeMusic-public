"""«Моя волна» (MIXES.md 7): an endless stream for the user's taste, handed out 5 tracks at a time and picked again
after every action.

- A session (`WaveSession`) keeps a pool of candidates made by the generators of «Микс дня» (`app.mixes.build`:
  the same sources, filters and score), the tracks handed out and not started yet, the last 50 played, and the
  session's own skips and likes. Started from a track or an artist («Волна по треку») the pool comes from that
  seed's radios and the seed plays first; without one — from the taste profile, as a mix. A wave by a Navidrome
  artist (the app's «Радиостанции») adds the artist's library songs to its Deezer radios; its artist plays once in 3.
- A wave by a chart or genre (`app.charts`, seed `{"chart": id}`): the chart's tracks join the pool (the higher the
  place, the better the score) with the YouTube Music and Yandex radios of its first 3 tracks; a refill takes the
  radios of its next ones. The session's learning and the filters are the same.
- Every `next` brings the events since the previous one and picks again: an early skip (< 30 s) or «Не нравится»
  lowers the artist and what sounds like the track (the embedder's vectors); a ♥ or a track played to its end adds
  its YouTube Music radio to the pool (`session_radio`) and raises what sounds like it. An artist plays at most once
  in 8 tracks; the mode keeps the familiar share of a mix.
- The tracks the client still has ahead (`queued`) are picked again with the rest: the answer replaces them.
- Sources answer at their own pace: a request waits for them `wave_wait_s`, what comes later joins the pool in the
  background (one lock per session). A pool running low is refilled from the radios of the next seeds.
- Tracks play as a stream from the Hub (their files are prefetched); one played to its end is downloaded quietly,
  as an economy import downloads a track once listened to (a ♥ downloads it anyway: the clients' ♥).
- For the admin's analytics (INSIGHTS.md 6.2–6.4) a session keeps where and by what client it was started, and every
  track handed out goes to `wave_items`; a session not asked for `KEEP` has its heavy state cleared to a summary,
  the row stays. The wave itself never reads any of it.
