"""Listening before downloading (GET /api/listen): the file a download of a catalog track would pick, streamed
through the Hub with Range support.

The file is chosen the way the download pipeline does it (catalog meta → Cyrillic original → provider order →
search + rank). Picking it is what takes seconds, so it is kept off the tap:
- a pick is remembered for weeks (`catalog_cache`, key `listen:{ref}`): only the CDN link behind it expires, and
  that is renewed on the fly;
- the PWA names the tracks on the user's screen (`prefetch`) and the Hub picks them in the background, checking
  that the file opens. Background work yields to taps and downloads (`app.net.Priority`): a hitmoz request or a
  yt-dlp slot goes to a user request first;
- a tap that finds nothing ready searches all sources at once and takes the first one in source order that has
  the track. The stream itself opens the file; when it does not open, the next candidate takes over.
Ranking skips the track page (hitmoz: Explicit/Clean, real bitrate). Once the user has listened, the Hub checks
the chosen file in the background; a download of that ref tries the heard file first if the check passed.
Owned tracks play from the library; when no source has the track, Deezer's 30 s preview plays (`kind="preview"`).

A provider's file found in the Files tab of the search is listened to the same way, by its ref "file:<provider>:<id>"
(`remember_files`): no pick, the file itself, prefetched while on screen. A source that has no plain HTTP audio
(`streams = False`: SoundCloud, HLS) is listened to from a copy the Hub downloads first, kept for a few hours.

The stream of a picked file is served from its server copy (`_Copy`): the Hub downloads the whole file to its disk at
its own speed and the player reads the copy as it grows, so a CDN that drops the connection midway (googlevideo does)
is resumed by the Hub instead of reaching the player, and seeks and the next requests are served from disk. The next
track of a queue is copied ahead, so a switch to it streams from disk at once instead of waiting for its source: the
app loads the start of its next tracks (`X-HomeMusic-Prefetch`), the web player names its next track
(`GET /api/listen?ahead=1`, `load_ahead`). A copy for the track being played goes first: copies loaded ahead wait
while one for a played track downloads.

For a metered network the stream can be asked for the light variant (`quality="mobile"`, `app.light`): the Opus copy
of the file when it is heavy (the copy of a catalog track is made from its server copy). Copies are made ahead of
time (`warm_light`: a mix's songs, a wave's tracks); a stream that finds none ready waits a moment, then serves the
original and says so (`Media.variant`) while the copy is finished in the background.
